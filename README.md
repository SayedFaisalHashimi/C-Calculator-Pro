# MathToolkit-C
A modular and extensible C-based mathematical toolkit that demonstrates the power of function pointers and structured programming.
This project features a multi-purpose calculator supporting arithmetic, trigonometric, factorial, power, modulus, and conversion functions.

Designed for students and developers who want to learn advanced C programming concepts such as arrays of function pointers, modularity, and mathematical computation handling.

Key Features

Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power
Factorial, square root, and average calculations
Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) for both X and Y values
Degree and Radian conversions
Function pointer-based menu system for flexible extensibility
Clear structure and easy expansion for future math or engineering operations
